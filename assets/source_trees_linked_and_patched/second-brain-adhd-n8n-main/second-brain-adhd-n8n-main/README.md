# 🧠 Second Brain for ADHD – n8n + Notion + Telegram Reminders

A personal task management automation designed for people with ADHD, built using n8n, Notion, and Telegram.
Automatically reminds you about tasks until you mark them as Done or Abandoned.


# 📌 Overview

This workflow turns your Notion database into a central task hub.

* If a task’s status is In Progress, the system will periodically send reminders via Telegram until it is updated to Done or Abandoned.
* Reminders stop automatically once the task is updated.
* Works best for people who forget tasks despite good intentions.

# Workflow Logic:

1. Notion Database → stores tasks and their statuses.
2. n8n → checks task status and decides whether to send reminders.
3. Telegram Bot → delivers periodic reminders directly to your phone.
